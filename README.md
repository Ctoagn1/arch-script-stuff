# arch-script-stuff
Some basic bash scripts I'm using, mainly just to apply pywal to stuff. Call the color-changing scripts in whatever script you use to change your wallpaper/use pywal- as for the notifications, I just made them systemd services. Also, the discord theme is specifically for system24.
